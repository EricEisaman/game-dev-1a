## Jump Delay

The Character type should get a jumpDelay property taking a number value in milliseconds.  The jumpDelay value will be implemented to determine how long after a character is "In Air" state before they switch to the jump animation.  This will avoid awkward jump transitions when the user is very briefly "In Air" while moving over objects and terrain.
